# Alternate Implementation for Marrying Explainable and Fair Supervised Models

This folder contains the original repository included in the NeurIPS submission of Marrying Explainable and Fair Supervised Models. This does not contain the optimization approach and provides basis to combine the [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and [AIF360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360) library to get input influence measures of AIF360's sklearn methods.
