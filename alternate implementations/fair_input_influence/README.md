# Marrying Fair and Explainable Machine Learning
This version of code is an heavily cut and early version meant to supplement our current paper.
A new library combining this and other work is in-progress but not ready to share.
### Notes:
- Smaller versions of our experiments can be run from the notebook ii_main.ipynb
- See environment.yml for environment used.
- Installing aif360[all] will give more of the requires libraries.
- Code saves and reads CSVs
- Census dataset has many samples and can have a long training time.
